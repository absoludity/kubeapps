    # Apparently VSCode overrides the default command if you specify a Dockerfile
    # or docker image, but it doesn't appear to if you specify a docker-compose.
    # So instead, ensure it's overridden when opening with VSCode so that the
    # dev server can be started and stopped or alternativelry the telepresence console
    # can be started.
